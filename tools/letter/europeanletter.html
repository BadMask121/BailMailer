                                                    <p><strong><br />I am very sorry I have to reach you through this medium. I am a member of the European Debt Recovery Unit and I am aware of your sad ordeal about your unpaid fund.<br /><br />It may interest you to know that not long after the Debt Management Office (DMO) completed the merger and acquisition process of all pending payments occasion through the petition raised by the international community about their unpaid funds. I discovered that their boss connived with some top officials to divert funds approve to settle unpaid Fund (concealed funds).<br /><br />The DMO has already given approval for the payment of your fund but they deliberately withheld your payment file and continue to demand fees from you through their associates from different unassigned affiliates mostly from Africa, US , Europe and Asia all in an attempt to frustrate you and enrich themselves. I wonder why you haven't notice all this while.<br /><br />You may choose to disbelieve this email as inconceivable but my doctrine does not permit such act, reason I have to open up to you to seek the right channel. Your fund was authorized to be paid to you through the DMO asset management firm<br />with a Key Tested Reference/Claim Code Number, which was supposed to have been issued to you before now.<br /><br />Upon your response to my message, I shall guide you through and provide you with details to contact the assigned affiliate who will facilitate the release of your fund.<br /><br />Thanks and have a wonderful day.<br /><br />Yours Faithfully,</strong><br
